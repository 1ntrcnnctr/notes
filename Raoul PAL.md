## #economy, rhyming #history
### observation
- the in 2020 presumed insolvency phase didnt happen
- the worst recession in history lasted for 2 months
- global economy is weakening (weak credit cycle, GDP growth falling)
- FED cut interest rates twice after every recession since 1962, a spike in bond deals happened too afterwards
- economic stimulus doesnt show in CPI, but rather in fall of the value of fiat
- prices that went up include housing (but rent too), healthcare (in effect from 'Baby Boomers'), education (generation 'Z')
- wages under-performed almost everything while assets got more expensive: future self gotten poorer
- Macroeconomics and crypto are merging together
- "Asian crisis" in 1997-98 was driven by sovereign and corporate debt (collapse of stock market by 90%, assets by 80%): had the effect of cut interest rates, a rally in equity prices, hedge funds investing in the "internet boom", yet the debt bubble continued and led to the "financial crisis" of 2008
### assumption
- market thinks inflation is an enemy, we likely see a slow down
- a rise in value of equities, real estate, most assets, crypto currencies is likely
- CPI going up by inflation almost impossible: generation 'Baby Boomers' consumes less (largest wave of retirees in history in 2020) plus the rest still working compete w the generation 'Millenials' on the job market, more globalization happening (influence of China, India), more adoption of industrial automation, AI, robotics, IoT happening

## [[Russia]]
### observation
- Russias GDP raise in 2002 was the effect of passing oil ownership from state to private institutions

## #society, #zeitgeist, #narrative, "4th Turning"
### observation
- current situation is an effect from the generation 'Silent' gotten in euphoria after WW II, producing the 'Baby Boomers'

### assumption
- the way we understood the world for the last 400 years is about to change

## [[DLT]], #cryptocurrency
### observation
- fastest change in history: current adoption rate of crypto is 113% per year (comparison: internet peaked at 63%)
- evaluation of whole crypto market currently $ 2T, global equities market $ 200T, bond market 200T, real estate 100T (absorption results in 100x value of crypto market)
- wallet management w seed phrase too tedious for adoption (has to change)
- most people dont understand authenticity and scarcity in the culture & art space (artistic NFTs under-appreciated)

### assumption
- adoption: 1B people until 2024, 3B people until 2028, fear of change and technology is hindering it the most
- possible to rebuild entire system from scratch w DLT
- exponential rise of price value for ETH the only possible outcome (supply going down, demand rising)
- ETH price likely to collapse after 'ETH 2.0' milestone, when staking rewards get unlocked
- multi chain future likely
- current "regulation barrier" is just noise
- social tokens (music, sport) will be the biggest driver for adoption
- price prediction until end of next "bull cycle": ETH $ 20k, BTC $ 250k
- BTC ETF likely coming in 2021

## #commodities 
### assumption
- materials and oil unlikely to keep value high bc of technology advancement

## #culture, #art 
### observation
- Ian Rogers an influential player (Ledger, Beats, music apps, LVMH)

### assumption
- Metaverse inevitable

# 2022-05-02
## #economy, rhyming #history
### observation
- we're seeing supply shocks that we haven't seen since possibly World War II, or certainly since the 1970s
- If you're not raising wages, or you can't raise prices as a corporation, the high prices that you've got are demand destruction, they're a tax on consumers and businesses.
- financial conditions are now tightening and they're getting to levels where we should start to see economic growth suffer significantly
- The cost of capital rose globally at an extraordinary pace.
- #1974 period looks most similar: the Arab oil embargo. The Arabs basically took oil out of the economy, and said, you can't have it. Now, what that did was drive up the price of oil. Same with the Russian situation now. And what happened was CPI exploded. It went up from about 3% and went up to 12%. Very similar to the kinds of numbers we see now.
- #2010 is when we stopped QE1, the market sold off, it created this W pattern. We had a growth scare. And then the market took off as people realized that the central bank were going to have to re-put QE back out. And the equity market took off
- #2015 and #2016, that's the next time we really saw the same setup. This time, the Fed were talking about raising rates. 2016, they said we're going to raise four times this year, and we're going to do it 25 basis points, they managed one and had to stop, because what happened is the market fell apart
- #2018 is even more similar to now. And what happened then was we had quantitative tightening. And we had interest rates rising. The yield curve had gone negative, and we had this final sell-off whoosh low, which was the taper tantrum. That taper tantrum was then the yield curve was negative, and the Fed was like, okay, the Powell pivot. In the Powell pivot, equity markets took off
Â - After World War II, we had the biggest supply shock the world had ever seen as demand came on globally. And what we saw was an explosion in prices. But inflation then fell back because of demand and settled into a period.
- Debt to GDP coming out of the wall was extremely high. But financial repression of not letting interest rates rise too much, but letting inflation run a little bit, 3%-ish, eroded the value of the debt over a 15-year period. And debt didn't become the issue.
### assumption
- the forward-looking growth is going to decelerate so rapidly that people are not prepared for it yet.
- Now, what happened (according to observation of history above) was exactly what I'm expecting.

## [[China]]
### observation
- Chinese Credit Impulse has led the world economy for a while because China's a huge part of the global economy.
- has been tightening credit, essentially a recession
- never report negative numbers
- starting to stimulate now
- leads the world by 12 months
- the yuan has to weaken, because everybody else is weakening their currencies, and they can't be outcompeted. And you know what, the world probably needs a cheaper yuan, because that lowers the cost of exports out of China, which moderates inflation. It also throttles their ability to import, so that lowers demand.
### assumption
- Chinese economy suggests we're going to get a full recession in the US. This maps to the global PMI too.


## [[Europe]]
### observation
- close to a recession already
- ECRI weekly indicator year-on-year has been falling very sharply, and has come to very moderated levels. if it starts across zero, then we're getting close to a contractionary phase. It's not there yet, but the warning signs are coming at this because of the speed of the decline. The only good sign is if I just take the index itself, not the year-on-year, it's not declining, it's been going sideways. And that suggests that maybe we avoid the recession.
### assumption


## #society, #zeitgeist, #narrative, "4th Turning"
### observation
- labor force participation rate has been falling due to demographics for decades
- Those people who are in the workforce have got higher incomes, but it's not as much as inflation
- technology is lowering the cost of everything
- The labor force participation rate falls, which I've talked about. But it doesn't make it easy for people who don't have transferable skills
- There's no pricing power for labor because of technology
- With that many retirees, we can't see wages driving up inflation over time.
- Inflation does not change the technological advance or the rate of adoption of networks

### assumption
- exchanging labor in China, India and other countries, and converting it to robots in the United States. That is a shift that's not going away. And it actually helps with an aging population because you have less people in the workforce over time
- US population growth at best is stable over the next 20, 30 years, at worst is going negative like the rest of the world. But pretty much all the rest of the developed world, including China is now starting to see negative population growth.


## #housing
### observation
- mortgage rates have exploded
### assumption

## [[Bonds]]
### observation
- for the first time ever, bonds are just following the ISM as of today.
- Bonds are not consistent with the S&P and not consistent with the dollar.
- The bond market is currently not pricing economic weakness
- We've got a short, sharp cycle, something we've not had for a very long time

### assumption
- the bond market is going to peak in yields any day now and will probably be a rolling peak over the next couple of months. And that will be the peak in the cycle of interest rates. 


## [[Federal Reserve]], #interest-rates
### observation
- already raised 25 basis points
- We've got this setup where the [[Yield Curve]] is going to tell us there's a #recession. When the yield curve crosses zero, it's 100% chance of a recession
- Negative real rates is incredibly positive for the equity market

### assumption
- every time we raise rates, the yield curve falls
- going to tighten
- They need to raise 50, they need to raise 100, they need to raise 11 times. But you guys don't get that the bond market's already done it for them. We actually don't need a central bank


## [[USD]]
### observation
- a strong dollar means that US #stocks are attractive
### assumption
- probably good the dollar moderate growth will moderate inflation


## [[XAU]]
### observation
- Gold does well with negative real rates
- Negative real rates have been diminishing, and gold sold off
### assumption
- gold seems to be now forward looking on growth, much the same way the technology stocks are on crypto
- starting to pick up somewhere that negative real rates are coming back
- if global growth slows, gold will take off

## [[DLT]], #cryptocurrency
### observation
- Crypto adoption is now massively outperforming the #internet, it's been growing at about 165% a year versus 85% of the internet for the same period of time now
- [[BTC]] log chart using the regression channel, one standard deviation oversold.
- [[ETH]]/BTC a running flag. And normally that results with an upside break
### assumption
- If inflation goes, crypto takes off
 - One standard deviation oversold is as big and oversold as crypto as Bitcoin ever gets (log chart)
- we should see a significant outperformance of ETH over BTC over time

## #commodities 
### observation
- [[Copper]] is structural shortfall 

### assumption
- we're probably in a secular bull market in commodities. No, it won't drive inflation.
- will be for at least a decade, maybe longer
